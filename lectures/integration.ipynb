    "To form the finite element integrals we need to be able to evaluate integrals of the form $\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_i \\phi_j dx$, $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j dx$ and $\\int_{\\Omega} f ~ \\phi_i~ dx$. \n",

    "As we will see later, we decompose the domain into a set of elements $\\{T\\} =: \\mathcal{T}_h$ and then decompose the integration problem into the element problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will assume that the domain of integration is a single element $T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This element furthermore can be mapped to a *reference element* of same type (segment, triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron, hexahedron) so that the fundamental integration problem to solve is the integration over the reference element.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the reference interval the previously mentioned integrals could be solved analytically.  However, for coefficient functions that are not polynomials, e.g. in the r.h.s. source terms or the diffusivity, this is soon not possible. Therefore, most often **numerical integration** is used in finite element codes."
